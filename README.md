# Horsing-Around-
A dayâ€™s worth of prize money at the Singapore Turf Club horse races reaches around $500,000, not including the amount punters spend betting on these races. With such large amounts of money in the industry, there is a lack of an easily accessible analytics platform to help punters make a more informed decision on which horse to bet on. Our goal is to create such a horse racing analytics platform, where all relevant information is easily available, understood, and customizable.
