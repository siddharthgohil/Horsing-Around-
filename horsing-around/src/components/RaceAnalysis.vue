      <h4 class="pick">1st Pick: WILD BEE (10)</h4>
      <h5 class="pickAnalysis">
        He is a seven-time winner in his career and holds the lowest rating of
        this field. The last time we saw him run at this distance was in July
        where he finished fourth beaten a length just under a length to the
        winner. Nice each way chance.
      </h5>
      <h4 class="pick">2nd Pick: WHAT YOU LIKE (9)</h4>
      <h5 class="pickAnalysis">
        All four of his victories have come on the Polytrack. He does however
        have a few nice placings to his name in similar conditions. Winning form
        is good form for a race like this. Nunes in the saddle a big plus for
        him.
      </h5>
      <h4 class="pick">3rd Pick: GRIFFIN (3)</h4>
      <h5 class="pickAnalysis">
        Having his second start in this grade after a disappointing start to his
        Singapore career. If he can bring any of his Australian form to this, he
        can surprise and figure in the finish.
      </h5>
      <h4 class="pick">4th Pick: WHIZ FIZZ (7)</h4>
      <h5 class="pickAnalysis">
        Has been met with betting support at his last few runs. Has since
        trialed nicely behind Jupiter Gold with the blinkers applied. Watch the
        market again for any moves.
